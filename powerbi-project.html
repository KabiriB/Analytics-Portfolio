        <h1>Power BI Project: Supermarket Sales Analysis</h1>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This Power BI project provides a     data-driven analysis of supermarket sales    , helping uncover 
                key revenue trends, customer behavior, and performance insights across different locations. 
                The report explores     city-wise sales distribution, revenue trends over time, top product 
                performance, and payment preferences     to guide business decisions.

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sales Performance by City:</strong> 
                    <br>Among the three branches,     Naypyitaw leads in total revenue     with     111K in sales    , 
                    followed closely by     Yangon and Mandalay, both at 106K    . This suggests a balanced sales 
                    distribution but highlights potential opportunities for further optimization.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Revenue Trends Over Time:</strong> 
                    <br>The sales timeline shows     consistent fluctuations    , indicating seasonal demand shifts. 
                    Notable     peaks in revenue     correspond to     specific sales periods    , promotional campaigns, 
                    or external factors such as holidays. Identifying these trends can help in     predicting future 
                    sales spikes and optimizing inventory    .
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Top-Performing Product Lines:</strong> 
                    <br>The     most revenue-generating product categories     include     Food & Beverage, Sports & 
                    Travel, and Electronic Accessories    . These products consistently drive sales, suggesting 
                    opportunities to     introduce bundling, targeted promotions, or loyalty rewards     for repeat purchases.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Customer Payment Preferences:</strong> 
                    <br>Sales data highlights a     diverse range of payment methods    , with     cash and e-wallets     
                    being the most frequently used.     Credit card payments account for a smaller share    , 
                    presenting an opportunity to     introduce incentives for card transactions     to boost adoption.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Customer Segmentation & Purchase Behavior:</strong> 
                    <br>Analysis of customer type shows that     members tend to spend more     across all payment 
                    methods, reinforcing the     value of loyalty programs    . Expanding     membership benefits     
                    could further     drive customer retention and repeat purchases    .
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Sales Trends by Time:</strong> 
                    <br>    Daily and monthly sales trends reveal fluctuations    , with specific periods seeing sharp 
                    revenue spikes. These patterns emphasize the importance of     seasonal promotions, 
                    stock optimization, and demand forecasting    .

            <h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Expand Targeted Marketing in Underperforming Cities:</strong> 
                    <br>While Naypyitaw leads in revenue,     Yangon and Mandalay show potential for growth    . 
                    Implementing     localized promotions, customer engagement campaigns, and community outreach     
                    can drive higher sales in these areas.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Optimize Inventory & Supply Chain Management:</strong> 
                    <br>Given the     revenue peaks and fluctuations    , ensuring optimal stock levels is crucial. 
                        Leveraging predictive analytics     to anticipate high-demand periods can     prevent stockouts 
                    and overstocking issues    , enhancing supply chain efficiency.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Introduce Payment-Based Promotions:</strong> 
                    <br>With     cash and e-wallets dominating     transactions, introducing     discounts or cashback 
                    incentives for credit card payments     could encourage diversification and improve checkout flexibility.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs:</strong> 
                    <br>Since     members show higher spending patterns    , expanding membership benefits, such as 
                        exclusive discounts, personalized offers, and reward points    , can     boost repeat purchases     
                    and improve customer retention.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <strong>Leverage Sales Timing for Maximum Impact:</strong> 
                    <br>Aligning promotional activities with     historically high-sales periods     can     maximize revenue    . 
                    Implementing     flash sales, limited-time offers, and holiday discounts     at peak demand times will 
                    enhance customer engagement.
